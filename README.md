Basics of Flex Box

Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) in CSS is a layout model designed to arrange items efficiently in a container, even with dynamic or unknown sizes. 

It simplifies alignment, distribution, and spacing of items in horizontal (row) or vertical (column) directions.
Key container properties include display: flex;, flex-direction, justify-content, align-items, and align-content. 
Flex items can use properties like flex, order, and align-self for individual control.
Flexbox is ideal for creating responsive layouts as it dynamically adjusts items based on available space.
It ensures consistent alignment and spacing, making it a powerful tool for modern web design.
